# Challenge #1: Reverse a String

## Problem

A classic problem in the realm of interviews, reversing a string might be a problem considered a softball by your interviewers. In modern high level languages this can be quite simple, but if you're working in a lower level language it can present a modest challenge.

Create a function `reverseString` that takes a single argument (the string to reverse) and return the reversed string. Your solution must be able to handle spaces, special characters, and preserve string casing.
