# Challenge #2: Tip Calculator

## Problem

How about a real-life coding problem? Whenever I used to go to restaurants with my parents as a kid, my dad would make me calculate a tip when the bill came. Let's do this with code!

Write a function `tipCalculator` that calculates the tip given an amount of money. Use **%15** as your tip amount. This function should return an amount that's **rounded to two decimal places**.

Examples:

* If the bill is $100.00, the tip should be $15
* If the bill is $11.00, the tip should be $1.65
* If the bill is $23.85, the tip should be $3.58 (_not_ 3.5775!)
